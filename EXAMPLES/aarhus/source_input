# f0 set to 1.2e4 to make the simulation start at t0=-1.2/f0=-1e-5, i.e. basically 0.
# The source.stf file contains values starting from this t0, up to tmax (i.e., NSTEP), with nonzero values appearing 0.25/f later than start time, i.e. at t_real = t0+0.25/f = 0.25/f-1e-5.
# Non-zero values can be expected at iterations > (0.25/f)/dt = 1200.
# Source time function will be finished inputting energy after iteration (3.25/f)/dt = 15500.

# Remark for quake simulations: one should give M_0 and not M_w (either in Mxx, Mzz, and Mxz or in factor).
# M_0 = 10^(3*M_w/2 + 9.05) [N.m].
# M_w = (2/3)*log(M_0*10^7) - 10.7 (with M_0 in [N.m]).

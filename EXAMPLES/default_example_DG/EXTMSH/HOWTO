How to use an external mesh?

1) Define the geometry in extMesh.geo.

2) Use GMSH to produce a .msh file from that .geo file (either from command line or using the GUI).

3) Use the provided .sh script to convert the GMSH .msh file to SPECFEM external mesh files.

4) In the simulation's parameter file:
4) a) Set 'read_external_mesh=.true.'.
   b)  i) If element order was set to 1 during the meshing, set 'ngnod=4'.
      ii) If element order was set to 2 during the meshing, set 'ngnod=9' ('ngnod=4' can also work, but is not advised).

Known issues:
*) When using the DG extension, spurious signals tend to remain on some elements' boundaries.
>) Using structured meshes and 'USE_SPREAD_SSF=.true.' tend to mitigate that issue.

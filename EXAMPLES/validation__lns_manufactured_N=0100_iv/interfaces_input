# Number of interfaces:
 2

# For each interface, give the number of points defining it, and coordinates (x, z) for each point.
# If you are using DG, it is recommended to have the variable "coord_interface" (in the "Discontinuous Galerkin" section of the parfile) agree either with the fluid-solid interface (for cuopled simulations) or the bottom of the mesh (for DG only simulations). While working most of the time, it is safer to do so.
# Interface 1 (bottom of the mesh):
 2
 -1e9 0
  1e9 0
# Interface 2 (top of the mesh):
 2
 -1e9 1
  1e9 1

# For each layer (number of interfaces - 1), give the number of spectral elements in the vertical direction.
# Recommended: N = f_0 * Np * th / vp, where N is the number of elements, f_0 the highest expected frequency, Np the wanted number of points per wavelength, th the layer's thickness, vp the layer's P-wave speed.
# Layer 1 (bottom and only layer):
 100

# Note: If you are using an external atmospheric model for DG (MODEL=external_DG in parfile), you can use the script './utils_new/Atmospheric_Models/model_getdxdt.m' to produce automatically the best interface and layers.

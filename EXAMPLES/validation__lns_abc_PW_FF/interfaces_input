# Number of interfaces:
 3

# For each interface, give the number of points defining it, and coordinates (x, z) for each point.
# Interface 1 (bottom of the mesh):
 2
 -1.d9 0.d0
  1.d9 0.d0
# Interface 2 (end of interest):
 2
 -1.d9 50.d0
  1.d9 50.d0
# Interface 2 (top of the mesh):

 -1.d9 60.d0
  1.d9 60.d0

# For each layer (number of interfaces - 1), give the number of spectral elements in the vertical direction.
# Recommended: N = f_0 * Np * th / vp, where N is the number of elements, f_0 the highest expected frequency, Np the wanted number of points per wavelength, th the layer's thickness, vp the layer's P-wave speed.
# Layer 1 (bottom and only layer):

# For each interface, give the number of points defining it, and coordinates (x, z) for each point.

# For each layer (number of interfaces - 1), give the number of spectral elements in the vertical direction.
# Recommended: N = f_0 * Np * th / vp, where N is the number of elements, f_0 the highest expected frequency, Np the wanted number of points per wavelength, th the layer's thickness, vp the layer's P-wave speed.

# Note: If you are using an external atmospheric model for DG (MODEL=external_DG in parfile), you can use the script './utils_new/Atmospheric_Models/model_getdxdt.m' to produce automatically the best interface and layers.

# Number of interfaces:
 2

# For each interface, give the number of points defining it, and coordinates (x, z) for each point.
# Interface 1 (bottom of the mesh):
 2
 -50.d0 -50.d0
  50.d0 -50.d0
# Interface 2 (top of the mesh):
 2
 -50.d0 50.d0
  50.d0 50.d0

# For each layer (number of interfaces - 1), give the number of spectral elements in the vertical direction.
# Layer 1 (bottom and only layer):
 50

# For each layer (number of interfaces - 1), give the number of spectral elements in the vertical direction.
# Recommended: N = f_0 * Np * th / vp, where N is the number of elements, f_0 the highest expected frequency, Np the wanted number of points per wavelength, th the layer's thickness, vp the layer's P-wave speed.

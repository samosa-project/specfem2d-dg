The scripts for writing compatible atmospheric models should accomodate for the format definitions described below.

The format of 1D atmospheric models ("MODEL = external_DG" in parfiles) is defined by the reading done in the source code.
This is done by the routine 'define_external_model_DG_only' in 'src/specfem2D/define_external_model.F90'.

The format of 2D atmospheric models ("MODEL = LNS_generalised" in parfiles) is also defined by the reading done in the source code.
This is done by the routine 'lns_read_background_model' in 'src/specfem2D/lns_load_background_model.F90'.

For 1D models, some quantities are not used anymore by the solver.
They have not been removed yet, but should be in the future for performance. In the meantime, they can remain here and are informative anyhow.
They are:
- H (scale height),
- N^2 (Brunt-Vaisala frequency),
- mu_vol (artificial viscosity to account for rotational attenuation),
- w_M (meridional wind),
- w_Z (zonal wind).
